This project is part of the research study to investigate the behavior of Zebra Fish. Nearly 200GB of videos have been used as the training/testing data. The final model has been developed using the Fast RCNN method. The training/testing data, as well as the final model, are removed from the repository to maintain the researchers' concern regards to the IP.
